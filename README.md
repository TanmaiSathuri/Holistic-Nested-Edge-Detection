# Holistic-Nested-Edge-Detection
This project is an advanced deep learning algorithm for accurate edge and object boundary detection in images. HED addresses limitations of traditional edge detection methods by employing an end-to-end learning approach using fully convolutional neural networks (FCN) and deeply-supervised nets (DSN).
